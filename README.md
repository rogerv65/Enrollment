# Enrollment
My project is designed as a mock-up enrollment system that would be used by universities (specifcally tailored towards CSULB). User's have the ability to add, list, or delete a department, course, section, major, student, enrollment, and student_major. Utilizes pymongo to establish a connection with the mongodb database.
## How to Install
The user must first have pymongo installed. 
The user must then set up their mongodb cluster (refer to the mongodb documentation).
The user must then connect their cluster by modifying "main.py" and setting the 'cluster' variable with the link to their database.
